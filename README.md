## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Arham!

Welcome to my GitHub profile â€” I'm a tech enthusiast with a growing focus on **data engineering**, **cloud technologies**, and **AI/ML systems**.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Building **data pipelines** using AWS services like **S3**, **Redshift**, and **Glue**
- Reproducing cutting-edge **NLP research papers** (recently from EMNLP 2024)
- Contributing to projects at the **UIC Sandbox Lab**, where we explore **spatial computing** using **Apple Vision Pro** devices

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Advanced **AWS Data Engineering concepts** (preparing for DEA-C01 certification)
- **Distributed data processing** with Spark and Kafka
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and their applications in agent-based simulations

### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Data pipelines, ETL/ELT projects
- Research-oriented machine learning or NLP projects
- Open-source tools for education or accessibility

### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- Transitioning from data science to **data engineering**
- Working with **Word2Vec**, **TF-IDF**, **NLTK**, and **scikit-learn**
- Using **AWS** for cloud data workflows
